            <p>Creative Endurance Lab ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Family Park Finder mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding how we handle data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data. Our core principle is to protect your privacy and collect as little information as possible.</p>

            <p><strong>Family Park Finder is designed to be used without collecting or storing your personal data.</strong> Your use of the Service signifies your understanding of this approach. </p>

            <h2>Information Handling Practices</h2>
            <p>We are committed to transparency. Below, we detail what information, if any, is processed and how it's handled. <strong>Our app does not store your personal data.</strong></p>

            <h3>Data Handling Details</h3>

            <h4>Personal Data</h4>
            <p>The Family Park Finder app itself <strong>does not request, collect, or store any Personal Data</strong> from you for its core operation. You can use all app features without providing personally identifiable information.</p>

            <h4>Usage Data & Analytics</h4>
            <p><strong>Family Park Finder does not collect or store any Usage Data or perform user analytics that track your individual behavior within the app.</strong> We do not monitor which specific parks you view, how often you use filters, or other similar interaction patterns. Our aim is to provide a service without unnecessary data collection.</p>

            <h4>Location Data</h4>
            <p>If you grant the Family Park Finder app permission to access your device's location, we use this information ("Location Data") in real-time SOLELY to provide location-dependent features, such as displaying nearby parks on the map or in search results. </p>
            <p><strong>Crucially, your Location Data is not stored by us, neither on your device (by the app beyond its immediate use) nor on our servers.</strong> It is processed ephemerally to deliver the requested feature and then discarded. We do not track your location history or build a profile based on your location.</p>
            <p>You can enable or disable location services for the Family Park Finder app at any time through your device's settings. If location services are disabled, features requiring your current location will not be available.</p>

            <h4>Tracking & Cookies Data</h4>
            <p>The Family Park Finder app itself does not use cookies or any other tracking technologies.</p>

            <h2>Favorites Data</h2>
            <p>The Family Park Finder app allows you to save favorite parks or campgrounds. This "Favorites Data" is <strong>stored exclusively locally on your own device.</strong> We, Creative Endurance Lab, do not collect, store, transmit, or have any access to this Favorites Data. It remains under your control on your device and is not shared with us or any third party through the app.</p>

            <h2>Transfer of Data</h2>
            <p>As the Family Park Finder app does not collect or store your Personal Data or Usage Data on our servers, the typical considerations for transferring such app-related data across jurisdictions do not apply to your in-app activity.</p>

            <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us (e.g., reservation links). If you click a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
            <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
            <p>We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
